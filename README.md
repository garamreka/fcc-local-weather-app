<h1>Local Weather App</h1>
<p>This project is my solution for Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front End Development Project called Show the Local Weather. The goal of the exercise is to show weather data in the current location, set different icon and/or background image according to the weather and be able to toggle between celsius and fahrenheit. I used <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery</b> to complete it.</p>
