<h1>Local Weather App</h1>
<p>This project is my solution for the old Free Code Camp version's Intermediate Front End Development Project called Show the Local Weather. The goal of the exercise is to show weather data in the current location, set different icon and/or background image according to the weather and be able to toggle between celsius and fahrenheit. I used <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery</b> to complete it.</p>
<p>User Story</p>
<ul>
<li>User can see the weather in my current location.</li>
<li>User can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.</li>
<li>User can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.</li>
</ul>
